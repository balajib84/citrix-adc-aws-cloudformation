## CloudFormation Template description
There are two templates:


1. `CFT1-aws_autoscale_prereq.template`: This creates IGW, Security Groups and IAM Roles. This also creates AZ specific NAT, Route Tables and Subnets.
2. `CFT2-aws_autoscale_prereq.template`: This creates AZ specific NAT, Route Table and Subnets only.

> Use `CFT1-aws_autoscale_prereq.template` only once

> Use `CFT2-aws_autoscale_prereq.template` for subsequent AZs


## Pre-requisites
- VPC need to be created before running these CFTs

## Network architecture
